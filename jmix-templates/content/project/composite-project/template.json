It enables transparent refactorings and eliminates the need to publish add-ons before using them in other add-ons and applications.<p>This template is best suited for the case where subprojects are stored in separate source code repositories.<p>The created structure contains the aggregating <code>all</code> project with a set of build scripts. Refer to its README file for more information.</html>",
