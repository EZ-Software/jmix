It enables transparent refactorings and eliminates the need to publish add-ons before using them in other add-ons and applications.<p>This template is best suited for the case where subprojects are stored in a single source code repository.<p>The created structure contains the aggregating project build scripts in the root folder. Refer to the README file for more information.</html>",
